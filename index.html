        <h2>Tomorrow's Technology, Today</h2>
        <p>
          We're accelerating the adoption and development of self-driving vehicles by making it possible for you to build one yourself. Existing self-driving cars are extremely expensive toys that only <a target="_blank" href="http://inhabitat.com/stanford-universitys-self-driving-audi-tts-hits-120-mph-on-the-racetrack">students at private schools</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/about/careers/lifeatgoogle/self-driving-car-test-steve-mahan.html">the wealthiest companies</a> have access to. We believe that paradigm-shifting technologies like the Internet belong in the hands of everyone, where they can realize their full potential.

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          We constructed our prototype using simple hand tools and off-the-shelf parts over half a semester. By keeping costs down, and removing unnecessary barriers to construction, we've demonstrated that motivated students can put together a working vehicle on a reasonable timeframe and budget.

        <h2>Approachability</h2>
        <p>
          We chose a tricycle for the base of the vehicle for many reasons. It has just enough room to mount all the electronics without obstructing the rider, while staying compact enough to store in your garage (next to your real car). It's mechanically simple, with replacement parts available at your local bike shop. Most importantly, it's hard to lose your balance on a tricycle, and manual control is obvious should the electronics or software fail.

        <h2>We Need Your Help</h2>
        <p>
          We're a small team of three undergraduate computer science majors who've ventured into the world of mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. We've bitten off quite a bit more than we can chew here, and especially need help in these fields:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>LiDAR</li>
            <li>Control Systems</li>
            <li>Computer Vision</li>
            <li>Cyber-Physical Simulations</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Sponsor Us</h2>
        <p>
          We've put significant amounts of our own time and money into this project, and we need help accelerating our progress.

        <h3>Illinois Administration &amp; Faculty</h3>
        <p>
          We need space to store the test vehicle, preferably somewhere near the Quad (that's a great testing area). Grant or scholarship money would allow us to construct more test vechicles, which means bringing more students into the project and increasing its impact.

        <h4>What You Get In Return</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Recruit amazing engineers by showing them what they get to work on at Illinois</li>
            <li>Give current students an opportunity to stretch themselves outside the classroom</li>
            <li>Use existing research on computer vision in a new way</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Corporate Sponsors</h3>
        <p>
          We need computers, cameras, LiDAR arrays, IR sensors, and batteries. Hardware like this is difficult for a bunch of college students to purchase on a whim, and your support would significantly speed up development.
        </p>
        <h4>What You Get In Return</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>A prominent mention on our website and marketing materials</li>
            <li>A team of smart, driven students battle testing your hardware</li>
            <li>We'll create media to promote your hardware by showing it in action</li>
